# Heap-based-Priority-Queue

Implemented a Heap-based Priority Queue class in C++ from scratch which :
- Can be set to any base (n-ary trees) with a default set to base 2.
- Allows the user to pass in a function object that can be used to sort the heap accordingly (i.e. minHeap, maxHeap, etc.).
- Has optimized efficiency of O(logn) for push and pop functions and O(1) for top function.
